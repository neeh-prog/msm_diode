# MSM Diode Fabrication using ZnO on Silicon

This project documents the fabrication and basic understanding of a Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM) diode using a Silicon substrate, ZnO thin film, and Aluminium contacts. The work was carried out in our college semiconductor fabrication lab.

 Fabrication Steps
1. **Wafer Cleaning** – Standard cleaning of n-type Silicon wafer.
2. **ZnO Deposition** – Deposited a thin layer of ZnO using [RF SPUTTERING].
3. **Aluminium Contact Deposition** – Patterned and deposited Aluminium to form MSM structure.

 What I Learned
- MSM diodes form **two back-to-back Schottky junctions**, unlike PN photodiodes.
- **ZnO**, with its wide bandgap, is ideal for UV detection and fast response.
- The role of **metal work function** and **semiconductor properties** in forming Schottky barriers.
- Key fabrication challenges: surface cleanliness, contact adhesion, and uniform deposition.

 Observations
- Device showed rectifying behavior typical of MSM diodes.

 Future Work
- Characterization under UV light
- Extracting Schottky barrier height and ideality factor
- Exploring other metal contacts (e.g., Au, Pt)
